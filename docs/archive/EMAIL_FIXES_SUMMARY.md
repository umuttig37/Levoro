# Email Notification System Fixes

## Summary of Changes

All high-priority issues from the email notification system analysis have been fixed. This document summarizes the changes made.

---

## 1. Fixed Hardcoded Localhost URLs ✅

**Problem**: Admin notification emails had hardcoded `http://localhost:8000` URLs that wouldn't work in production.

**Solution**:
- Added `BASE_URL` environment variable support
- Updated all URL generation to use `os.getenv("BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")`

**Files Modified**:
- `services/email_service.py` (lines 270, 303, 336, 426)

**Environment Variable Added**:
```bash
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Update for production
```

---

## 2. Standardized Admin Email Configuration ✅

**Problem**: Inconsistent admin email configuration across different notification methods:
- Some used hardcoded `support@levoro.fi`
- Others used `admin@levoro.fi`
- Only driver applications used environment variable

**Solution**:
- Standardized all admin notifications to use `ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable
- Consistent fallback to `support@levoro.fi`

**Files Modified**:
- `services/email_service.py` (lines 260, 292, 329)

**Environment Variable Added**:
```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL=support@levoro.fi
```

## 3. Implemented Missing Driver Assignment Emails ✅

**Problem**: Code referenced non-existent email methods:
- `send_driver_assignment_email()` - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- `send_customer_driver_assigned_email()` - NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Solution**:
- Implemented both missing email methods with proper templates
- Integrated with existing driver assignment workflow in `order_service.py`

**New Methods Added**:
1. `send_driver_assignment_email(driver_email, driver_name, order_data)`
   - Notifies driver when assigned to an order
   - Includes order details and link to job page

2. `send_customer_driver_assigned_email(customer_email, customer_name, order_data, driver_data)`
   - Notifies customer when driver is assigned
   - Includes driver contact info and order tracking link

**Files Modified**:
- `services/email_service.py` (new methods added at lines 509-635)

---

## 4. Fixed Driver Approval Email Method Bug ✅

**Problem**: Driver service called non-existent method `send_driver_approval_email()` instead of correct method name.

**Solution**:
- Updated method call to use correct name: `send_driver_application_approved()`

**Files Modified**:
- `services/driver_service.py` (line 272)

---

## 5. Centralized Status Translation Logic ✅

**Problem**: Duplicate status translation code in 3 different files:
- `email_service.py` (lines 182-206)
- `order_service.py` (lines 239-267)
- `app.py` (lines 235-265)

**Solution**:
- Created centralized utility module: `utils/status_translations.py`
- Consolidated all status translations and descriptions
- Updated all files to import from central location

**New File Created**:
- `utils/status_translations.py`
  - `STATUS_TRANSLATIONS` dictionary
  - `STATUS_DESCRIPTIONS` dictionary
  - `translate_status()` function
  - `get_status_description()` function

**Files Modified**:
- `services/email_service.py` (line 181)
- `services/order_service.py` (lines 237-245)
- `app.py` (lines 235-243)

---

## 6. Moved Inline HTML to Template Files ✅

**Problem**: Driver application emails had inline HTML (400+ lines) making them hard to maintain.

**Solution**:
- Created proper Jinja2 template files for all driver application emails
- Moved HTML from Python strings to template files
- Updated email service methods to use `render_template()`

**New Template Files Created**:
1. `templates/emails/driver_application_confirmation.html`
2. `templates/emails/driver_application_approved.html`
3. `templates/emails/driver_application_denied.html`
4. `templates/emails/admin_driver_application.html`

**Files Modified**:
- `services/email_service.py`:
  - `send_driver_application_confirmation()` (line 313)
  - `send_driver_application_approved()` (line 359)
  - `send_driver_application_denied()` (line 506)
  - `send_admin_driver_application_notification()` (line 339)

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Admin email for system notifications
ADMIN_EMAIL=support@levoro.fi

# Base URL for email links (update for production)
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, test:

- [ ] User registration email
- [ ] Account approval email
- [ ] Order creation email
- [ ] Order status update emails
- [ ] Driver application confirmation
- [ ] Driver application approval
- [ ] Driver assignment notifications (both driver and customer)
- [ ] Admin notification emails (verify correct email address)
- [ ] Email links work correctly (check BASE_URL configuration)

---

## Benefits

1. **Production Ready**: URLs now configurable for production environment
2. **Consistent Configuration**: All admin emails use centralized configuration
3. **Complete Notifications**: Driver assignment now properly notifies all parties
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized status translations reduce code duplication
5. **Easier Updates**: Email templates can be updated without touching Python code
6. **Bug-Free**: Fixed method name bug preventing driver approval emails

---

## Technical Debt Remaining (Lower Priority)

These issues were identified but not critical for immediate deployment:

1. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling across email methods (some silent, some print)
2. **Plain Text Conversion**: Basic HTML-to-text conversion could be improved
3. **Email Queue**: No retry or queue system for failed emails
4. **Unused Code**: `send_driver_application_denied()` exists but never called
5. **Monitoring**: No centralized logging or email delivery tracking

Consider addressing these in future iterations.

## Migration Notes

No database migrations required. All changes are code-only and backward compatible.
