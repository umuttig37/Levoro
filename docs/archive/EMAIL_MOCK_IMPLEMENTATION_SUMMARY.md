# Development Email Mock System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Core Feature
A complete email mock system for development that:
- Saves all emails as HTML files instead of sending them
- Creates a beautiful web-based inbox to browse emails
- Auto-refreshes to show new emails in real-time
- Works only in development mode (FLASK_ENV=development)

---

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### Modified Files:
1. **services/email_service.py**
   - Added `dev_mode` flag detection
   - Modified `send_email()` to intercept in dev mode
   - Added `_save_email_to_file()` method
   - Added `_update_email_index()` method

### Created Files:
1. **static/dev_emails/.gitignore** - Prevents committing test emails
2. **static/dev_emails/.gitkeep** - Keeps directory in git
3. **DEV_EMAIL_MOCK_SYSTEM.md** - Complete documentation
4. **EMAIL_WORKFLOW_TEST_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step testing guide
5. **test_email_mock.py** - Quick test script

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Email Inbox Interface (index.html)
- **Auto-generated** list of all emails
- **Auto-refreshes** every 5 seconds
