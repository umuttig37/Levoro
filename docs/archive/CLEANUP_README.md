# Database Cleanup Guide

## Problem Fixed

When users/drivers were deleted, their driver applications remained in the database, preventing them from re-registering with the same email address.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Cleanup Script** (`cleanup_orphaned_records.py`)
One-time script to remove orphaned driver applications.

### 2. **Bug Fix** (`app.py`)
Fixed validation logic to automatically delete orphaned applications during re-registration.

### 3. **Enhanced Deletion** (`routes/admin.py`)
Improved user deletion with better error handling and logging.

---

## How to Use the Cleanup Script

### Step 1: Dry Run (Check what will be deleted)

```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Run in dry-run mode to see what would be deleted
python cleanup_orphaned_records.py
```

This will show you:
- Total driver applications in database
- How many are orphaned (no corresponding user)
- Details of each orphaned record
- **NO CHANGES ARE MADE**

### Step 2: Review the Output

The script will display something like:

```
===========================================================
ORPHANED DRIVER APPLICATIONS CLEANUP
===========================================================
Mode: DRY RUN (no changes will be made)

Total driver applications: 15
Valid applications (with users): 12
Orphaned applications (without users): 3

ORPHANED APPLICATIONS FOUND:
------------------------------------------------------------
  ID: 5
  Email: deleted_user@example.com
  Name: John Doe
  Status: pending
  Created: 2025-01-10 14:30:00
```

### Step 3: Delete Orphaned Records (If you approve)

```bash
# Run in live mode to actually delete orphaned records
python cleanup_orphaned_records.py --live
```

You'll be asked to confirm:
```
⚠️  WARNING: LIVE MODE - Records will be permanently deleted!
Are you sure you want to continue? (yes/no):
```

Type `yes` and press Enter.

## What Happens After Cleanup?

### Immediate Effect
✅ Orphaned driver applications are removed
✅ Emails from deleted users become available for re-registration
✅ Database is clean and consistent

### Going Forward (No Manual Intervention Needed)

**Scenario 1: User Deletion**
- Admin deletes a user → System automatically deletes their driver application
- Enhanced error handling logs any issues
- Email becomes available immediately

**Scenario 2: Re-Registration Attempt**
- Someone tries to register with email of deleted user
- System detects orphaned application (if it exists)
- Automatically deletes the orphaned record
- Allows new registration to proceed

## Production Deployment

### Before Deploying

1. **Run cleanup script in production** (in dry-run mode first):
   ```bash
   heroku run python cleanup_orphaned_records.py --app your-app-name
   ```

2. **Review output carefully**

3. **Run in live mode** if everything looks correct:
   ```bash
   heroku run python cleanup_orphaned_records.py --live --app your-app-name
   ```

### Deploy Code Changes

```bash
git add app.py routes/admin.py cleanup_orphaned_records.py
git commit -m "fix: Remove orphaned driver applications and prevent future occurrences"
git push heroku main
```

## Future Improvement (Optional)

For even more robust data management, consider implementing **soft delete**:

**What is soft delete?**
- Users aren't actually deleted from the database
- They're marked as `deleted: true`
- All queries ignore deleted users
- Email becomes available immediately
- Can reactivate users if needed
- No orphaned references ever

**Benefits:**
- 100% data integrity
- Full audit trail
- Reversible deletions
- No manual cleanup needed

Let me know if you'd like to implement soft delete in the future!

## Troubleshooting

### Script fails with "ModuleNotFoundError"
Make sure you've activated the virtual environment:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Script shows no orphaned records but registration still fails
1. Check if the user still exists: Look in admin panel or database directly
2. Check application logs for the specific error message
3. Verify environment variables are correctly set

### Need to manually check the database?
You can use MongoDB Compass or the MongoDB shell to inspect:
```javascript
// Check users
db.users.find({email: "specific@email.com"})

// Check applications
db.driver_applications.find({email: "specific@email.com"})
```
