- **docs/features/**: Feature implementations and architecture
- **docs/testing/**: Testing guides and procedures
- **docs/archive/**: Completed fixes, deprecated features, historical summaries

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, descriptive filenames (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.md)
- Include date created/updated
- Mark status (‚úÖ Complete, ‚è≥ In Progress, üöß WIP)
- Keep CLAUDE.md and issues.md always up to date
- Archive completed fix summaries after merging

## üîÑ Maintenance
