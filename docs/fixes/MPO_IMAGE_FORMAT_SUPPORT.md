# MPO Image Format Support - Testing Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive testing instructions for verifying MPO (Multi-Picture Object) image format support in the admin panel image upload system.

## What is MPO Format?
MPO (Multi-Picture Object) is an image file format that contains multiple JPEG images, typically used for:
- **3D Photography**: Stereoscopic images from 3D cameras
- **Multi-angle shots**: Different perspectives of the same scene
- **Burst mode**: Sequential images in rapid succession

### Devices That Create MPO Files
- **3D Cameras**: Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3, W1
- **Smartphones**:
  - HTC EVO 3D
  - LG Optimus 3D (P920)
  - Older dual-lens camera phones
- **Digital Cameras**: Select Fujifilm, Panasonic, Sony models with 3D capability

## Problem That Was Fixed

### The Error
Client reported: **"PO file type not supported"** error in production admin panel when uploading multiple images.

### Root Cause
1. MPO support was previously added (commit 3b2b91f on Oct 5, 2025)
2. MPO support was reverted (commit e07f707 on Oct 6, 2025)
3. Backend validation in `services/image_service.py` rejected MPO files
4. HTML `accept` attribute couldn't prevent MPO file selection
5. PIL correctly identified MPO format, but validation rejected it

### The Fix
- **Re-added 'MPO'** to allowed formats in `services/image_service.py`:
  - Line 289: `_validate_file()` method
  - Line 316: `_process_image()` method
- **Fixed typo**: `'WEBP,'` (trailing comma) → `'WEBP'`
- **Automatic conversion**: MPO files are converted to JPEG during processing

## How to Test MPO Support

### Option 1: Use Test MPO Files (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Obtain MPO Test Files
You can download sample MPO files from:
- **Sample MPO Images**: Search for "sample MPO file download" or "3D MPO test image"
- **Camera Manufacturer Sites**: Fujifilm, Panasonic provide sample files
- **Stock Photo Sites**: Some 3D image repositories

#### Step 2: Verify File Format
On Windows:
```bash
# Check file type using Python
python -c "from PIL import Image; img = Image.open('test.mpo'); print(f'Format: {img.format}')"
```

Expected output: `Format: MPO`

### Option 2: Use Real Device
If you have access to a device that creates MPO files:
1. Capture photos using 3D mode or burst mode
2. Transfer MPO files to your computer
3. Verify format as shown above

### Testing Procedure

#### Test 1: Single MPO Upload
1. **Navigate to admin panel**
   - URL: `https://your-production-domain.com/admin`
   - Log in with admin credentials

2. **Select an order**
   - Go to "Kaikki tilaukset" (All orders)
   - Click on any order to open detail view

3. **Upload single MPO file**
   - Scroll to "Noutokuvat" (Pickup images) section
   - Click "Valitse noutokuvat" button
   - Select one MPO file from your computer
   - Observe upload progress

4. **Verify success**
   - ✅ Upload completes without errors
   - ✅ Image displays correctly in image grid
   - ✅ No "PO file type not supported" error
   - ✅ Image counter increments (e.g., "1/15 kuvaa")

5. **Check converted file**
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Inspect image `src` attribute
   - URL should end with `.jpg` (converted to JPEG)
   - Example: `orders/123/123_pickup_abc123.jpg`

#### Test 2: Multiple Mixed Format Upload
1. **Prepare test files**
   - 1x MPO file
   - 1x JPEG file
   - 1x PNG file
   - 1x WebP file (if available)

2. **Upload all files simultaneously**
   - Click "Valitse lisää kuvia" button
   - Select all 4 files at once
   - Click "Open"

3. **Verify batch upload**
   - ✅ All 4 files upload successfully
   - ✅ No errors displayed
   - ✅ Upload queue shows progress for each file
   - ✅ Image counter shows correct count (e.g., "4/15 kuvaa")
   - ✅ All images display in grid

4. **Verify format conversion**
   - All images (including MPO) should be converted to JPEG
   - Check file URLs - all should end with `.jpg`

#### Test 3: MPO File Processing Verification
1. **Upload MPO file to pickup images**

2. **Check file size**
   - Original MPO file size (before upload)
   - Uploaded JPEG file size (after processing)
   - Uploaded file should be:
     - ✅ Compressed (80% quality)
     - ✅ Resized if wider than 1200px
     - ✅ Smaller than original MPO file

3. **Visual quality check**
   - Click on uploaded image to open modal
   - Image should display clearly
   - No artifacts or corruption
   - Appropriate resolution for viewing

#### Test 4: Edge Cases

**Test 4A: Large MPO File**
- Upload MPO file larger than 1200px width
- ✅ Should resize to 1200px max width
- ✅ Aspect ratio preserved

**Test 4B: Very Large MPO File**
- Upload MPO file larger than 5MB
- ✅ Should fail validation with size error
- ✅ Error message: "Tiedosto on liian suuri (max 5MB)"

**Test 4C: Corrupt MPO File**
- Try uploading a renamed non-image file as `.mpo`
- ✅ Should fail validation
- ✅ Error message: "Kuvatiedosto on vioittunut tai ei kelvollinen"

**Test 4D: Maximum Images Limit**
- Upload 15 images (including some MPO files)
- Try to upload another MPO file
- ✅ Should show limit reached message
- ✅ Upload form hidden or disabled

### Testing Checklist

**Before Testing:**
- [ ] Deploy updated `services/image_service.py` to production
- [ ] Restart application server
- [ ] Verify Python PIL/Pillow version supports MPO (Pillow ≥ 2.4.0)

**Admin Panel Tests:**
- [ ] Single MPO upload succeeds
- [ ] Multiple MPO uploads succeed
- [ ] Mixed format upload (MPO + JPEG + PNG) succeeds
- [ ] MPO files converted to JPEG
- [ ] Image quality is acceptable
- [ ] No "PO file type not supported" errors
- [ ] Upload progress indicators work
- [ ] Image counter updates correctly

**Storage Verification:**
- [ ] Files saved with `.jpg` extension
- [ ] Files organized in `orders/{order_id}/` folder
- [ ] GCS upload works (if GCS enabled)
- [ ] Local fallback works (if GCS disabled)

**Error Handling:**
- [ ] Oversized MPO files (>5MB) rejected properly
- [ ] Corrupt MPO files rejected properly
- [ ] Clear error messages displayed to user

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For Valid MPO Files:
1. **Validation**: MPO format passes PIL validation check
2. **Processing**:
   - MPO file opened by PIL
   - Converted to RGB mode if needed
   - Resized to max 1200px width (if necessary)
   - Saved as JPEG with 80% quality
3. **Storage**:
   - Filename: `{order_id}_{type}_{uuid}.jpg`
   - Location: `orders/{order_id}/` (GCS or local)
4. **Database**: Image metadata stored with JPEG file path

### Technical Flow:
```
MPO Upload → _validate_file() [✅ MPO allowed]
          → _process_image() [✅ MPO allowed]
          → PIL converts to JPEG
          → Save as .jpg file
          → Upload to GCS/local
          → Return success
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "MPO file type not supported" still appears
**Solution:**
1. Verify `services/image_service.py` has been deployed
2. Restart application server (Gunicorn/Flask)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check Python environment has correct Pillow version

### Issue: MPO upload succeeds but image doesn't display
**Possible causes:**
1. GCS upload failed (check logs)
2. File path URL incorrect (check browser console)
3. CORS headers missing (if using GCS)
4. Image processing failed (check server logs)

**Debug steps:**
```bash
# Check server logs for processing errors
tail -f /var/log/app.log | grep "Image processing error"

# Verify PIL can read MPO files
python -c "from PIL import Image; Image.open('test.mpo').show()"
```

### Issue: MPO files upload but are very large
**Explanation:** MPO files contain multiple JPEG images internally, so original size can be 2-3x larger than single JPEG.

**Expected behavior:** After processing, converted JPEG should be significantly smaller due to:
- Single image extraction (MPO → JPEG)
- 80% quality compression
- Resizing if width > 1200px

## Performance Considerations

### MPO Processing Time
- **Single MPO file**: ~2-5 seconds (depending on size)
- **Multiple MPO files**: Linear increase per file
- **Factors**: Original resolution, file size, server CPU

### Storage Impact
- **Original MPO**: 3-8 MB typical
- **Converted JPEG**: 500KB-2MB typical (80% quality, max 1200px)
- **Savings**: 60-75% size reduction

## Additional Notes

### Why MPO Support Is Important
1. **Device Compatibility**: Some users may have older devices that only save MPO
2. **3D Photography**: Growing use of 3D capture for documentation
3. **User Experience**: Prevents frustrating upload errors
4. **Automatic Conversion**: Users don't need to manually convert files

### Format Support Summary
After this fix, the system supports:
- ✅ JPEG/JPG
- ✅ PNG
- ✅ WebP
- ✅ MPO (NEW - automatically converted to JPEG)

### Not Supported (By Design):
- ❌ TIFF (too large, uncommon for web)
- ❌ BMP (uncompressed, inefficient)
- ❌ GIF (animated, not suitable for documentation)
- ❌ HEIC/HEIF (Apple proprietary, limited PIL support)
