# Order Confirmation Map Implementation

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Issue**: #15 - Map not drawing on order confirmation page  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

## Problem
The order confirmation page (final step of order wizard) did not display the route map, while the calculator page had this functionality working correctly.

## Solution

### Changes Made

1. **Fixed API Endpoint** (`order_wizard.py`)
   - Changed from non-existent GET `/route` endpoint to POST `/api/route_geo`
   - Used the same endpoint as the calculator page for consistency
   - Proper JSON payload with pickup and dropoff addresses

2. **Map Initialization**
   - Map now initializes on page load using `DOMContentLoaded` event
   - Uses `RouteMap` class (mini mode) for compact display
   - Fetches route data and draws polyline with markers

3. **Enhanced Styling**
   - Added distance label styling (blue badge on map)
   - Responsive design for mobile devices
   - Proper map sizing (250px desktop, 200px mobile)

4. **Emoji Removal**
   - Removed üè¢ (building) emoji from "Tilaaja" header ‚Üí "Tilaajan tiedot"
   - Removed üë§ (person) emoji from "Asiakas" header ‚Üí "Asiakkaan tiedot"
   - Consistent with copilot-instructions.md (no emojis in production)

## Technical Implementation

### Map Drawing Flow
```javascript
1. Page loads ‚Üí DOMContentLoaded event fires
2. Initialize RouteMap instance (Leaflet-based)
3. Fetch route from /api/route_geo (POST)
4. Receive: { latlngs, start, end, km }
5. Draw polyline + start/end markers
6. Display distance badge on map
7. Auto-fit bounds to show entire route
```

### RouteMap Class Features
- **Mini mode**: Simplified, static map (no zoom/pan)
- **Polyline rendering**: Full route geometry from OSRM
- **Markers**: Start (pickup) and end (dropoff) locations
- **Distance label**: Centered blue badge showing kilometers
- **Auto-fit**: Automatically adjusts view to show entire route

### API Endpoint Used
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/route_geo`
- **Request**: `{ pickup: string, dropoff: string }`
- **Response**: `{ latlngs: [[lat,lon],...], start: [lat,lon], end: [lat,lon], km: float }`
- **Backend**: Uses Google Maps Geocoding + OSRM routing

## Files Modified

1. **order_wizard.py**
   - Fixed map initialization code in `order_confirm()` function
   - Changed fetch request to use correct endpoint
   - Added distance label CSS styling
   - Removed emojis from confirmation cards

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Map displays on order confirmation page
- [x] Route drawn correctly with start/end markers
- [x] Distance badge shows correct kilometers
- [x] Mobile responsive (200px height on small screens)
- [x] No emojis in confirmation headers
- [x] Map matches calculator page style and functionality

## User Experience

### Before
- Confirmation page showed form data but no map
- User couldn't visualize the route before confirming
- Inconsistent with calculator experience

### After
- Full route visualization on confirmation page
- Users see exactly where the vehicle will travel
- Distance clearly displayed on map
- Professional appearance without emojis
- Consistent experience across calculator and confirmation pages

## Related Issues

- **Issue #15**: Map drawing on confirmation page ‚úÖ Fixed
- **Issue #8**: Similar request for order detail pages (to be addressed separately)
- **Emoji removal**: Partial progress on global emoji cleanup

## Next Steps

Consider applying similar map visualization to:
1. Order detail page (customer view) - Issue #8
2. Driver order detail page (show route to driver)
3. Admin order detail page (route visualization for support)

## Notes

- The map uses Leaflet.js (already loaded in calculator)
- OSRM provides free routing without API keys
- Google Maps Geocoding used for address ‚Üí coordinates conversion
- Map is static (no user interaction) to focus on confirmation
- Distance label CSS uses blue theme matching application design
